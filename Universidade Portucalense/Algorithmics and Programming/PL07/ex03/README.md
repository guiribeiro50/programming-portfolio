# Orange Classification by Volume

This program classifies an orange based on its volume, calculated from the diameter entered by the user.

## Problem Description

Using the formula for the volume of a sphere, the program determines the orange's classification:

* Volume ≤ 120 cm³ → Not classified
* 120 < Volume ≤ 250 cm³ → Class 1
* 250 < Volume ≤ 550 cm³ → Class 2
* Volume > 550 cm³ → Not classified

The volume is calculated using the formula:
V = (4/3) × π × (radius³), where the radius is half of the diameter.
