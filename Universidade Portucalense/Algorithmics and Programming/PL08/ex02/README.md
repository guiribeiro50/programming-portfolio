# Maximum and Minimum Value of a List

This exercise implements two functions that identify, respectively, the largest and smallest value in a list of numbers.

## Objectives

* `find_max(lst)`: returns the maximum value present in the list `lst`
* `find_min(lst)`: returns the minimum value present in the list `lst`

Both functions assume that the list contains at least one numeric element.

Test examples are included to validate the results.
