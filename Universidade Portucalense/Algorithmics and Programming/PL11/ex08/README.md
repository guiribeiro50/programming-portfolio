## Matrix Multiplication

This program allows the multiplication of two matrices, provided their dimensions are compatible.

### Objective

Implement the function `multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2)` which:

* Receives two matrices
* Checks dimension compatibility
* Performs matrix multiplication
* Returns the resulting matrix

A practical example is included to test the function and verify its correctness.
