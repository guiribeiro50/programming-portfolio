# Identification of Duplicate Elements

This program identifies and returns all elements that occur more than once in a list.

## Objective

Implement the function `find_duplicates(lst)` which:

* Receives a list `lst`
* Returns a new list containing the duplicated elements, without repetitions

The implementation ensures each duplicate is listed only once. Tests include lists with and without duplicates.
