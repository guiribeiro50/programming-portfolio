## Sorting by Score

This program defines a function that sorts a list of students based on their grade, in descending order.

### Objective

Implement the function `sort_by_score(students)` which:

* Receives a list `students` of tuples (name, grade)
* Sorts the tuples in descending order by grade
* Returns the newly sorted list

A practical example is included to test the function and verify its correctness.
