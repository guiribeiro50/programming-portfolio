## Linear Count of Occurrences

This program defines a function that counts how many times a given value appears in a list of integers through a linear search.

### Objective

Implement the function `linear_search_count(lst, target)` which:

* Receives a list `lst` of integers and a value `target`
* Traverses the list to count how many times `target` appears
* Returns that count

A practical example is included to test the function and verify its correctness.
