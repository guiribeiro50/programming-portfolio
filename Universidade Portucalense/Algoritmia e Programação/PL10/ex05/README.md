## Median of a List

This program defines a function that calculates the median of a list of integers.

### Objective

Implement the function `find_median(lst)` which:

* Receives a list `lst` of integers
* Sorts the list internally
* Calculates and returns the median, taking into account whether the number of elements is even or odd

A practical example is included to test the function and verify its correctness.
