## Student Search

This program defines a function that searches for a student's grade based on their name.

### Objective

Implement the function `find_student(students, name)` which:

* Receives a list `students` of tuples (name, grade) and a name `name`
* Searches for the name in the list and returns the corresponding grade
* Returns `"Student not found"` if the name does not exist in the list

A practical example is included to test the function and verify its correctness.
