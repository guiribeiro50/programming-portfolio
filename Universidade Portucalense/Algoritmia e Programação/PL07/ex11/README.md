# Perfect Number Verification

This program determines whether an integer is perfect.

## Problem Description

A number is considered perfect if the sum of its proper divisors (excluding the number itself) equals the number.

Example: 28 has divisors 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. The sum of these divisors is 28, so it is a perfect number.
