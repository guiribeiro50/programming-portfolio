# Return Day Calculator

This program calculates the day of the week on which a user returns from vacation, based on the departure day and the length of stay in nights.

## Problem Description

The days of the week are considered to be numbered from 0 to 6, with 0 corresponding to Sunday and 6 to Saturday. For example, departing on day 3 (Wednesday) and staying away for 10 nights, the return will occur on a Saturday (day 6).

The program requests the following data from the user:

* The number corresponding to the departure day (between 0 and 6)
* The number of nights of stay

Based on these values, the program calculates and displays the number of the day of the week corresponding to the return.
