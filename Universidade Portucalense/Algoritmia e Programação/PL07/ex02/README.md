# Compound Interest Amount Calculation

This program calculates the final amount of an investment with compound interest, based on the number of years provided by the user.

## Problem Description

The compound interest formula is used:

M = P × (1 + r/n) ^ (n × t)

Where:

* P is the initial capital (€10,000)
* r is the annual interest rate (8% or 0.08)
* n is the number of compounding periods per year (12)
* t is the number of years (provided by the user)

Using these values, the program calculates and displays the final amount after the specified period.
