# How to Run the Programs

To run the projects and exercises included in this repository, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer.

## Installing Python 3

### Windows:
Download the installer from python.org and follow the setup wizard. Make sure to check the option **Add Python to PATH** during installation.

### Linux:
Most Linux distributions come with Python installed. To check, open a terminal and run:
```bash
python3 --version
```
If not installed, use your package manager, for example on Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
```

### MacOS:
Mac usually comes with Python 2.x installed by default. To install Python 3, you can use Homebrew:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install python
```

## Running the Programs

After installing Python 3, open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Linux/Mac) and navigate to the folder where the Python script is located. Then run:

### Windows:
```bash
python file.py
```

### Linux / MacOS:
```bash
python3 file.py
```

Replace `file.py` with the name of the Python script you want to execute.
