# Sort List of Dictionaries

## Description
This exercise consists of writing a program that sorts a list of dictionaries based on a specific key.

## Objective
Create a program that:
- Takes a list of dictionaries as input
- Sorts the list based on a specified key
- Returns the sorted list of dictionaries
- Handles different data types for the sorting key
- Demonstrates sorting with custom key functions

## Implementation Instructions
1. **Create a function** that accepts a list of dictionaries and a key name
2. **Implement a sorting algorithm** (bubble sort, selection sort, etc.)
3. **Compare dictionary values** using the specified key
4. **Sort the list in place** or return a new sorted list
5. **Handle edge cases** like missing keys or empty lists

## Expected Result
After running the program:
- Returns a new sorted list of dictionaries based on the specified key
- Maintains the original dictionary structure
- Sorts in ascending order by default
- For example: sorting students by "age" returns list ordered from youngest to oldest

## Delivery
The file must contain a complete Python program that sorts dictionaries by key with tests incorporated.
