## Filtering Errors in Log Files

This program processes a log file and extracts only the lines containing error messages, saving them in a new file.

### Objective

Implement the function `filter_errors(input_file, output_file)` which:

* Reads the content of a log file
* Filters lines containing `[ERROR]`
* Writes only those lines to a new file named `error_logs.txt`

A practical example is included to verify the filtering results.
