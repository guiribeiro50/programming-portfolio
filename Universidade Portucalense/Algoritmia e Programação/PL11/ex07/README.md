## Matrix Addition

This program allows the addition of two matrices of equal dimensions, either input by the user or predefined in the code.

### Objective

Implement the function `add_matrices(matrix1, matrix2)` which:

* Receives two matrices with the same dimensions
* Adds the corresponding elements
* Returns a new matrix with the summed values

A practical example is included to test the function and verify its correctness.
