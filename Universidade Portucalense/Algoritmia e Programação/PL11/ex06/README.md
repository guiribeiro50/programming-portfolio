## Matrix Transposition

This program defines a function that computes the transpose of a matrix represented as a list of lists.

### Objective

Implement the function `transpose(matrix)` which:

* Receives a matrix (list of lists)
* Returns its transpose, swapping rows with columns

A practical example is included to test the function and verify its correctness.
