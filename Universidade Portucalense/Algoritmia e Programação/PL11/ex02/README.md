## Word Reversal

This program defines a function that reverses the content of each word in a sentence, keeping the order of the words unchanged.

### Objective

Implement the function `reverse_words(sentence)` which:

* Receives a sentence as a string
* Reverses each word individually
* Maintains the order of the words in the sentence
* Returns the resulting sentence

A practical example is included to test the function and verify its correctness.
