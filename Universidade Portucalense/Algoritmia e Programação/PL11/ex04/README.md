## Text File Analysis

This program analyzes the content of the file `user_text.txt`, counting the number of lines, words, and characters.

### Objective

Implement the function `analyze_file(filename)` which:

* Reads the content of a text file
* Counts the total number of lines, words, and characters
* Displays the results to the user

A practical example with an input file is included to validate the functionality.
