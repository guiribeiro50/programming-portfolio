## Counting and Replacing in Sentences

This program defines a function that processes a sentence and performs three operations: counts the total number of words, counts unique words, and replaces all vowels with asterisks.

### Objective

Implement the function `word_counter(sentence)` which:

* Receives a sentence as a string
* Counts the total number of words
* Counts the number of unique words
* Returns the modified sentence with vowels replaced by `*`

A practical example is included to test the function and verify its correctness.
