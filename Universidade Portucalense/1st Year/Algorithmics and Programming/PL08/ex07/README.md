# Fibonacci Sequence Generation

This program generates the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

## Objective

Create the function `fibonacci(n)` which:

* Receives an integer `n`
* Returns a list with the first `n` elements of the Fibonacci sequence

The sequence follows the formula:

F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

The function is tested with different values of `n`.
