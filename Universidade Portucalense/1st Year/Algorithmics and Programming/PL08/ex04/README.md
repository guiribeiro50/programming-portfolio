# Counting Even and Odd Numbers

This program analyzes a list of integers and calculates how many values are even and how many are odd.

## Objective

* Receives a list `lst` of integers
* Returns two values:

  * Number of even elements
  * Number of odd elements

The function is tested with example lists to validate its behavior.
