# Sum of Elements in a List

This program defines a function that receives a list of numbers and returns the sum of all elements in it.

## Objective

Implement the function `sum_list(lst)` which:

* Receives a list `lst` containing integer or decimal numbers
* Calculates the sum of all its elements
* Returns the resulting value

A practical example is included to test the function and verify its correctness.
