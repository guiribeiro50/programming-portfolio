## Sorting by Length

This program defines a function that sorts a list of strings in ascending order based on their length.

### Objective

Implement the function `sort_by_length(lst)` which:

* Receives a list `lst` of strings
* Sorts the elements based on the number of characters in each string
* Modifies the original list

A practical example is included to test the function and verify its correctness.
