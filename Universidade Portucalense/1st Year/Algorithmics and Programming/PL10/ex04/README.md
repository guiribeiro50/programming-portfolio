## Two Largest Elements

This program defines a function that finds the two largest values in a list of integers in a single pass through the list.

### Objective

Implement the function `find_two_largest(lst)` which:

* Receives a list `lst` of integers
* Identifies the two largest values
* Returns the two values in descending order

A practical example is included to test the function and verify its correctness.
