## Students with Highest Grade

This program defines a function that identifies all students with the highest grade.

### Objective

Implement the function `top_students(students)` which:

* Receives a list `students` of tuples (name, grade)
* Identifies the highest grade in the list
* Returns a list with the names of all students who achieved that grade

A practical example is included to test the function and verify its correctness.
