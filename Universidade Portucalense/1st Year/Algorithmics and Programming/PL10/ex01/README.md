## Selection Sort

This program defines a function that receives a list of integers and sorts its elements in ascending order using the Selection Sort algorithm.

### Objective

Implement the function `selection_sort(lst)` which:

* Receives a list `lst` of integers
* Sorts the elements of the list in ascending order without using the `sort()` method
* Modifies the original list

A practical example is included to test the function and verify its correctness.
