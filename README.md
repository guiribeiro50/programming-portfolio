# Programming Portfolio

This repository showcases a selection of projects I have developed throughout my academic journey as a Computer Engineering student at Universidade Portucalense, as well as projects completed during the Piscine at 42 Porto. It reflects my growth as a programmer, covering different areas such as algorithms, data structures, problem-solving, and software development.

Some exercises and projects were revisited and improved upon as I evolved and deepened my programming skills, demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning and refinement.

**Note on Lab Organization:** You may notice that some lab numbers are not sequential (e.g., jumping from Lab 9 to Lab 11). This is intentional - I have only included labs that showcase meaningful programming concepts and challenges. Basic foundational exercises covering very elementary topics have been omitted to focus on more substantial work that better demonstrates my technical capabilities and problem-solving approach.

## Repository Structure

This collection represents both my academic progression and practical application of programming principles, serving as a comprehensive overview of my development as a software engineer.
