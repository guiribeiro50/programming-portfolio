# Programming Portfolio

This repository showcases a selection of projects I have developed throughout my academic journey as a Computer Engineering student at Universidade Portucalense, as well as projects completed during the Piscine at 42 Porto. It reflects my growth as a programmer, covering different areas such as algorithms, data structures, problem-solving, and software development.

Some exercises and projects were revisited and improved upon as I evolved and deepened my programming skills, demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning and refinement.
