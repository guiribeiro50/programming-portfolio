# Exercise 00
## Description
This exercise consists of creating your ft.h file.
## Objective
Create a header file called `ft.h` that:
- Contains all prototypes of specified functions
- Includes proper header file structure
- Uses standard header protection
- Declares function prototypes correctly
- Uses no external functions
## Implementation Instructions
1. **Create the header file** named `ft.h`
2. **Add header protection** using include guards
3. **Include function prototypes** for all specified functions
4. **Follow proper header syntax** and formatting
## Expected Result
After creating the header file:
- Contains prototypes for ft_putchar, ft_swap, ft_putstr, ft_strlen, ft_strcmp
- Uses proper include guard structure
- Can be included in C source files without errors
## Delivery
The file must contain the ft.h header file with all required prototypes.
## Technical Notes
- No external functions are allowed
- Use include guards to prevent multiple inclusions
- Declare all function prototypes exactly as specified
- Follow standard C header file conventions
- Include prototypes: ft_putchar, ft_swap, ft_putstr, ft_strlen, ft_strcmp
