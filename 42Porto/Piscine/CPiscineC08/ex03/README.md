# Exercise 03
## Description
This exercise consists of creating a file ft_point.h that'll compile the provided main function.
## Objective
Create a header file called `ft_point.h` that:
- Defines a structure type t_point
- Contains x and y coordinates as integers
- Makes the provided main function compile correctly
- Uses proper structure definition syntax
- Uses no external functions
## Implementation Instructions
1. **Create the header file** named `ft_point.h`
2. **Add header protection** using include guards
3. **Define t_point structure** with x and y integer members
4. **Use typedef** to create the t_point type
## Expected Result
After creating the header file:
- The provided main function compiles without errors
- t_point structure can be used to create point variables
- Structure members x and y can be accessed with -> operator
## Delivery
The file must contain the ft_point.h header file with t_point structure definition.
## Technical Notes
- No external functions are allowed
- Use typedef struct to define t_point
- Include int members x and y in the structure
- Use proper include guard structure
- Follow standard C structure definition conventions
